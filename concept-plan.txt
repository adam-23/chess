Every piece has coordinates
every square has coordinates

2 sets of pieces
8 pawns
2 knights
2 rooks
2 bishps
1 king
1 queen

Every square has a name (A2, E2 for example)

Move order:
  check if king is in Check
    if so, 
    move king or eliminate piece
      if king is still in check after all options have been exhausted:
        trigger Checkmate
        
[Pick piece first, list moves, enter move desired]
 ----------------------------------------------
  player chooses piece to move
    piece loads movement protocol (bishop moves 1,1 or 1,-1, -1,1 -1,-1)
      move protocol lists available moves
        move protocol checks current position of all pieces of same color
          move protocol removes current positions from available moves
        person types in command
          command is checked with available moves
            if command is available move, change piece coordinate to new coordinate
              if new coordinate is on top of oppposing piece coordinate, opposing piece coordinate becomes (16,16) and is deactivated
            replace old coordinate piece with blank
------------------------------------------------


king check test
  (Check if own king is currently in check)
white enter move
  check if move is valid
  king check test
    (Check if own king is currently in check)
    if not valid move or king still in check if move would have been executed, ask for a new move
    if valid and own king not in check after valid move, piece modifies coordinates to new location
      if piece now shares coordinates with opposing piece
        move opposing piece to graveyard
    king check test
      (Check if enemy king is in check after)
       if enemy king in check, opposing player begins turn in check and must eliminate threat

[Enter piecename and move desired in single stroke]
------------------------------------------------
  load locations of opposing players
  load move protocols of said piece
    load available coordinates
      check if player entered move is in available move squares
        if yes, change piece coordinate to new square
          if piece coordinate = opposing piece coordinate:
            opposing piece coordinate sent to (0,0) and move protocol is no longer applied to it. Can no longer be accessed by player
    after moving, load move protocols of all player pieces and check if opposing king is in check. 
      if king in check, other player is loaded into check status.


[Check Status]
--------------
(after every move, analyze the board to see if king is in check)
  if king is in line of fire as available coordinate, check status is loaded
  player must propose a move
    check if proposed new location of king continues to put him in check
      if king is still in line of fire from another piece after moving, ask player to move again
        (idk how to check this, but analyze if there is any possible move that moves king out of the line of fire)
          (list all possible moves that put the king out of the line of fire)
          
          
          
[Piece Class]
--------------------
color (white or black)
death protocol
current location
starting location
In check status?
piece not allowed to go outside 1,1 or 8,8


[Pawn]
-------------------------------
if white:
  [movement protocol]
    coordinate = y coordinate +1
   [attack protocol]
    coordinate = y coordinate+1
    if x coordinate -1 is shared by opposing piece:
      x coordinate = x coordinate -1
     (same ocnditions for x +1)
    [skip protocol]
      if y coordinate = 2, first move can be y+=2
    [en passant]
      if pawn on row 6 and enemy pawn double jumps past, 
        y can move +1, and enemy pawn is sent to grave yard
    [upgrade protocol]
        if y coordinate = 8, pawn turns into Queen, Knight, Rook, or Bishop as specified by user
     
if black, y coordinate +=-1
 --------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
[Rook]
-------------- 
 [x move]
 check if any piece is in the x coordinates (1,8)
  if piece in x coord:
    if piece is opposing, move is still valid to replace
      piece gets replaced, sent to 0,0
      
      
  [y-move]
    check all available moves by minusing Y coordinates from current position
    change y coordinate to new coordinate
      piece gets replaced

[Knight]

X+2, Y+1
X-2, Y+1

  remove all moves that currently have a same piece in them, or if move would put king into check
