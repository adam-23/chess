Every piece has coordinates
every square has coordinates

2 sets of pieces
8 pawns
2 knights
2 rooks
2 bishps
1 king
1 queen

Every square has a name (A2, E2 for example)

Move order:
  check if king is in Check
    if so, 
    move king or eliminate piece
      if king is still in check after all options have been exhausted:
        trigger Checkmate
  
  decide piece to move
    piece loads movement protocol (bishop moves 1,1 or 1,-1, -1,1 -1,-1)
      move protocol lists available moves
        move protocol checks current position of all pieces of same color
          move protocol removes current positions from available moves
        person types in command
          command is checked with available moves
            if command is available move, change piece coordinate to new coordinate
              if new coordinate is on top of oppposing piece coordinate, opposing piece coordinate becomes (16,16) and is deactivated
            replace old coordinate piece with blank
